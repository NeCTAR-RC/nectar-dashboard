RC Allocation Web Application
=============================

Introduction
============

This site handles the application for allocations on the 
`NeCTAR Research Cloud <http://nectar.org.au/research-cloud/>`_ cloud by members of the research 
community.


Todo
====
* Add better table handling to the allocation request list template.

Notes
=====

Users should extend Django users - and not be separate as they currently are?
See `User authentication in Django <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/#storing-additional-information-about-users>`_
