      "message": "1) You have correctly understood what is going on.  Except that this are solely ranks that affect the ordering of menus and the like.  By calling them ranks we avoid having to place any deep meaning on the grouping ... and any temptation for other code to interpret them as having any meaning.  2) Renaming the rank field would require another migration.  Bad idea ... even if the name choice was poor ... which I disagree with.",
